# IoT Device Monitoring Platform

A cloud-native IoT monitoring platform built with **Django REST Framework**, **React**, **Docker**, **Terraform**, and **AWS EC2**.

This project simulates a fleet of IoT edge devices transmitting telemetry to a REST API. Incoming telemetry is stored in a database, monitored for threshold violations, and displayed through a responsive React dashboard. The application is containerized with Docker Compose, deployed on AWS EC2, and the cloud infrastructure can be recreated using Terraform.

## Key Highlights

- Built a full-stack IoT monitoring platform using Django and React
- Simulated real-time telemetry from edge devices
- Containerized the application with Docker Compose
- Deployed the application on AWS EC2
- Provisioned cloud infrastructure using Terraform
- Implemented RESTful APIs and interactive data visualizations

# REST API

| Endpoint | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `/api/devices/` | List all simulated devices |
| `/api/telemetry/` | Retrieve telemetry readings |
| `/api/alerts/` | Retrieve generated alerts |

---

# Running Locally

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nanakwamekankam/iot-device-monitoring-platform.git

cd iot-device-monitoring-platform
```

Start all services

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Verify containers

```bash
docker compose ps
```

Stop the application

```bash
docker compose down
```

---

# Running the Device Simulator

Start the backend first, then run

```bash
python simulator/device_simulator.py
```

The simulator continuously generates random telemetry and automatically creates alerts whenever configured thresholds are exceeded.

---

# Deployment

Update the server

```bash
git pull
```

Rebuild containers

```bash
docker compose down

docker compose up -d --build
```

Verify

```bash
docker compose ps
```
